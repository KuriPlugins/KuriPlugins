Having already developed plugins during the OpenOSRS times, like one-click-wintertodt, one-click-tempoross, one-click-gotr, and gauntlet-helper, among others, I've now decided to start Kuri Plugins.

The goal is to make OSRS a more chill and laid back experience for the long and repetitive grinds.

Don't expect to see plugins fully automated, the main objective of Kuri Plugins is to bring most skills/activities focus level to a maximum similar to what thieving is.

## A Few Plugins You Can Expect from Kuri Plugins
- Kuri Click Shop: One-click shopping at any shop in OSRS.
- Kuri Click Combine: One-click combining of items such as Herblore and Cooking ingredients.
- Kuri Click GOTR: One-click Guardians of the Rift minigame.
- Kuri Click Wintertodt: One-click Wintertodt minigame.
- Kuri Click Tempoross: One-click Tempoross minigame.
- Gauntlet Helper: An all-in-one tool for the Gauntlet and Corrupted Gauntlet.
- Zulrah Helper: An all-in-one tool for the Zulrah boss.
- OpenOSRS ported plugins
- ... And more!

Kuri Plugins goal is to allow you to do side tasks like watch YouTube, Netflix, or even read a book while doing repetitive tasks on OSRS. Our plugins are easy to use and fully customizable, so you can tailor your experience to your liking.
